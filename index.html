            <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am a 3rd-year Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto, majoring in <a href="https://engsci.utoronto.ca/program/majors/machine-intelligence/">Machine Intelligence</a>, with a strong interest in differential privacy, cybersecurity, and software development. Currently, I am pursuing an internship at <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.papernot.fr/">Prof. Nicolas Papernot</a>. Growing up, I traveled extensively due to my dad's profession as a Ship Captain—I am Singaporean and have lived in Montreal, Dubai, Kolkata, and Toronto. These experiences have shaped me into an adaptable and globally-minded individual. In my spare time, I enjoy visual arts, yoga, and reading.</p>
