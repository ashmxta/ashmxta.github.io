This is a minimalist personal website built using HTML and CSS to showcase my academic background, research experience, and more.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5** for content structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and layout  
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons and social links  
- **GitHub Pages** (initially) + **custom domain deployment** via [ashmita.ca](https://ashmita.ca)

## 🌍 Hosting & Deployment
In addition to designing the site, I learned how to:
- Deploy static websites using GitHub Pages
- Connect a custom domain to a GitHub-hosted site
- Configure DNS settings through a domain registrar
- Set up web hosting using a paid domain
